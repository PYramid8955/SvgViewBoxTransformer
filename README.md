# SvgViewBoxTransformer
### A program that automatically converts your SVG üñºÔ∏è to another viewBox, taking in count points, paths, positions and more! üéâ

#### To run the program you need to have **Python3** installed on your machine (preinstalled on the majority of linux systems) and **BeautifulSoup4**
- You can install the latest version of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) **__[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)__**.
- To install **BeautifulSoup4** just open your terminal, type `pip install beautifulsoup4` and press [Enter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_key).

> ## Dependencies:
> #### [Python3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) (the programming language)
> #### [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (to work with `xml`)

* After you have installed all the dependencies and downloaded the [source code](https://github.com/PYramid8955/SvgViewBoxTransformer) you can run the program by typing in the terminal (that's opened in the directory you downloaded the source code) `python3 ChangeViewBox.py` and pressing [Enter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_key).

<span color="red">* Make sure you downloaded both: ***ChangeViewBox.py*** and the ***Packages*** [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)).</span>

> ## What can this program do?
> - There are several options to choose from (you will see when you'll run it :D). E.g. It can read the code from an already created svg file and convert into the desired viewbox in the desired file. And it (should) work with any viewbox, for example **"0 0 16 32"**.
> - Currently the program is limited to changing `width`, `x`, `cx`, `rx`, `height`, `y`, `cy`, `ry`, `points`, `d`, `r`, `stroke-width`, therefore you could still need to change some parameters by yourself, taking `transform` for instance. But here comes the following option:
> - You can choose an option that will convert your desired number to another viewbox, yet this option, unlike the precedent one, ***[only](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/only)*** works with svgs with the same viewbox's height and width, for example "0 0 16 16", where 16 == 16.
